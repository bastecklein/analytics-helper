# analytics-helper
Javascript library for logging Google Analytics application view stats in a Javascript based application.

This is a small JavaScript library I created to log web application stats to Google Analytics.  It is small, lightweight, and gets the job done.  I use it in all Ape Apps JS based applications that are on the Web, NodeJS/Electron, or in a packaged Windows 10 Javascript application.
